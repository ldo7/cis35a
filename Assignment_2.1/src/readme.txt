	This file contains 2 java programs: 
	
	1. GenomeInput.java creates 3 HumanGenome objects and asks the user to input each individual's genetic information including a Genome name, 
		the number of genes, number of chromosomes, and number of cells in their Human Genome. The program then prints each person's genetic information.
	
	
	2. HumanGenome.java contains the blueprint to create a HumanGenome object and is instantiated in GenomeInput.java. The file contains a method to print an individual's genetic information, 
		and also has methods that allow the user to access and change an individual's genetic information(such as the genome name, number of genes, number of 
		chromosomes, and number of cells).
